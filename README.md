# 🚀 Startup Shakeup: Employment Trends in Indian Startups (2022–2025)

Built an end-to-end interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing the dynamic shifts in hiring and layoffs across Indian startups — using a combination of **real-world data** and carefully constructed **mock data** to better illustrate broader trends.

📉 **Key Insight**: Layoffs don’t always stem from lack of funding — several well-funded companies reported major layoffs, challenging common assumptions around job security.

This project addresses key questions:

- Which sectors and cities were most impacted by layoffs?  
- Are well-funded startups safer for employees?  
- Which roles and skills are still in demand despite downsizing?  
- Can a combined view of layoffs and hiring offer better insights into ecosystem trends?
